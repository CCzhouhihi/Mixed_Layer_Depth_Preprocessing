# NetCDF Interpolation and Preprocessing Toolkit

This project provides Python tools for reading, interpolating, and writing 2D NetCDF data. It is designed for oceanographic or meteorological data workflows, such as regridding mixed layer depth fields.


## Project Contents

- `_result_files/`: Output NetCDF files generated by processing scripts (e.g., interpolated results)
- `tools/`: Core utilities for NetCDF operations
  - `pre_function.py`: Includes five key functions:
    - `write_nc`: Write arrays and dimensions to an existing or new NetCDF file
    - `interp2d_nc`: Interpolate between two NetCDF files using a mask (not recommended)
    - `interp2d_array`: 2D linear interpolation on NumPy arrays
    - `getdata_nc`: Read and subset data from a NetCDF file
    - `getll_nc`: Extract longitude and latitude arrays
- `ssh_preprocessing.py`: Example script for sea surface height preprocessing
- `*.cdl`: CDL files used with `ncgen` to create NetCDF templates
  - `nwp_mask.cdl`, `nwp_mld.cdl`: Templates for target grid and result file structure
- `*.nc`: Input and intermediate NetCDF datasets
  - `HYCOM_inv_20190101-0103.nc`: Sample input file (e.g., mixed layer depth)

- `README.md`: Project documentation and usage instructions


## Usage

Run `ssh_preprocessing.py`.

## Notes

- Works best with 2D uniform gridded data
- Manual editing of dimension names may be required inside the code
- Interpolation assumes low-NaN input for accurate results
